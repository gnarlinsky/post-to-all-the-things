# post-to-all-the-things
#### Simple web interface to publish PyCU related messages to various services

This is meant to be a sustained PyCU group project, suitable for multiple contributors of varying skill levels.

##### Roughly:
* some simple framework, say Flask or lighter
* user registration/authentication
* form to input some message/announcement, like an upcoming Py-CU meeting
* upon submit, a bunch of services are used to post said message to at least: Facebook, Meetup, and Twitter
